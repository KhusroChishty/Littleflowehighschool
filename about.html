    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Established in 2007, LITTLE FLOWER HIGH SCHOOL was founded with the vision to provide high-quality education at a low cost. 
      Our primary focus is on underprivileged children who have a strong desire to learn but lack access to resources. 
      While many schools charge excessive fees for facilities like computer labs, robotics, sports grounds, libraries, and Islamic education,
      we are committed to offering these at an affordable price without compromising quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that every child deserves the right to learn and grow. Our goal is to empower the poor and underserved communities
      with knowledge, skills, and values.
