      <h3>Haritha Haram – Green Plantation Drive</h3>
      <div class="date">Posted on: 15th November 2024</div>
      <p>
        On 15th November 2024, our school actively participated in the Telangana Government’s Haritha Haram initiative. 
        Students and teachers together planted over 100 saplings within the school premises, spreading awareness on the importance 
        of trees and green cover. This drive was not just about planting but about nurturing environmental responsibility in our students. 
        We thank everyone for contributing to a greener tomorrow!

      <h3>Why Education Is Important in Today’s World</h3>
      <div class="date">Posted on: 10th October 2024</div>
      <p>
        In an ever-evolving world, education is the strongest weapon to face challenges and build a secure future. 
        At LITTLE FLOWER HIGH SCHOOL, we emphasize holistic development — academic knowledge, digital skills, communication, 
        and values. Education empowers children to dream big, overcome barriers, and become responsible citizens.
        With modern tools like digital learning, AI integration, and spoken English programs, we prepare them for real-world success.

      <h3>The Role of Parents in a Child’s Education</h3>
      <div class="date">Posted on: 28th September 2024</div>
      <p>
        Education doesn't stop at school. Parents play a vital role in nurturing a child’s curiosity and encouraging them 
        to strive for excellence. At our school, we ensure regular parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) to involve parents in their 
        child's journey. From moral support to monitoring progress, the partnership between teachers and parents can make 
        a significant difference in a child’s life and education.
